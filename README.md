# envsimpoc

This is a 3D version of my other repository [envsimpoc2d](https://github.com/NickDevoctomy/envsimpoc2d).

The intention of this project is to attempt to create a tile based map with environmental factors which could potentially be used in a game.

## Environmental Factors

### Temperature

Heat transfer between tiles, except for rock tiles which do not transfer heat.

## Notes

Please note that this code is merely a proof of concept and as such should not be used for anything serious without some major refactoring first.
